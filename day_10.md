## Exercises

Let's open our test files:

- [event loop](/src/day_09/eventLoop.test.js)
- [callback](/src/day_09/callback.test.js)
- [promise](/src/day_09/promise.test.js)
- [async/await](/src/day_09/asyncAwait.test.js)

Now open your terminal.

1. Make sure you're at the project location
2. If you didn't install all the packages yet then run `npm i` for a fresh dependency install, or `npm ci` for an installation based on the lock file.
3. Type `npm run test:watch`, this will start running your tests every time you make a change.

**Our task is to make ALL our DAY 9 tests pass ;)**
